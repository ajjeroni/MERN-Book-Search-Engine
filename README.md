# MERN-Book-Search-Engine

## Description

For this task, students had to refactor a MERN stack application from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. 

This was a challenging assignment but, nonetheless, a essential lesson to learn when expanding to new technologies that make development of application more effective.
